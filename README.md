# Firebase-Shop-List-App
Simple JS shopping list app using Firebase's Realtime Datatabase

*Update 1.5*

I created the ability to select where the item can be purchased by adding a select element and changing how the data is structured within Firebase's Realtime Database.

Before the user only has a regular list containing the item name and the quantity.

Now the user has the ability to select from a list of stores, each having it's own sublist where relevant items and quantity can be placed.

_This project is part of my learning journey with web development._
